# text data

#The letters listed here corresponds to the letters in the CHR-ROM.
#If you export the chr-rom data, you should see the image data for each
#character in the same order as they are listed here. You may edit both
#the chr-rom and the letters listed here to more conveniently edit the game text.

# "short" letters take 5 bits to store, and "long" letters take 10 bits to store.
# Space (" ") is always a 5 bit character, and need not be listed here.
